# Java-chatroom
Java program that simulates a group SMS/text chatroom that I created as a assignment for my Object-Oriented Design Programming class.
It supports an arbitrary number of of chat user that must be hard-code established in the main class file. The user types their message 
in the textfield and clicks the send button when finished, afterwards it is displayed on the chatroom screen with the user's name labeling 
it at the front.
