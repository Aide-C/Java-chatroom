# Java Chatroom

One of my java projects from my TXST Spring 2022 Object-Oriented Design & Programming course at TXST. 

## Description 

Java program that simulates a group SMS/text chatroom that I created using the OOP and SOLID principles I learned in class. It supports an arbitrary number of chat users that must be hard-coded in the main class file. The user types their message in the text field and clicks the send button when finished, afterwards, it is displayed on the chatroom screen with the user's name labeling it at the front.

## Getting Started
